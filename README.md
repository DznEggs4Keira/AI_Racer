## About AI_Racer

This Project was initial built with SFML in C++
However it has recently been ported over to Unity in C#

###### Description

As a Student project, it's purpose was to demonstrate a working AI controller which used Fuzzy to calculate it which direction a car would need to steer using two input values
- Velocity
- Distance

After the submission of the project for the course, i later decided to come back to this project and try to make it more exciting!
To do this, i decided to port it to Unity and mould it into a **Endless Runner** style game.
