## About AI_Racer
This Project was initial built with SFML in C++
However it has recently been ported over to Unity in C#

###### Description
As a Student project, it's purpose was to demonstrate a working AI controller which used Fuzzy to calculate it which direction a car would need to steer using two input values
- Velocity
- Distance

An alternative AI approach was also explored by creating an AI controller which instead uses Finite State machines to determine where it needs to steer.

After the submission of the project for the course, i later decided to come back to this project and try to make it more exciting!
To do this, i decided to port it to Unity and mould it into a **Endless Runner** style game.

###### Features
- Choose from an FSM steered car or Fuzzy Steered Car
- Avoid On coming obstacles
- Seperate Input window which allows manual input of values to test the Fuzzy AI **_(Brought in directly from Student Project)_**
